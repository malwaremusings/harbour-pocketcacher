Pocket Cacher
=============

My geocaching application for SailfishOS.

I have been wanting to create a phone based geocaching application for some time, as I haven't yet found one with all of the features that I'm after.
I finally decided to give it a go after getting a new phone and installing SailfishOS on it, and not finding an existing application that would work with geocaching.com.

This application is still in the very early stages of development, although it is at the stage where you can load a geocaching.com pocket query and use it to navigate to a cache.
It has a few bugs, which are mostly user interface issues/improvements as I only got this phone (and SailfishOS) in December and only started Qt/QML development a week ago.

I still have a lot of features that I want to implement, but I also have a full time job that keeps me busy during the week.
